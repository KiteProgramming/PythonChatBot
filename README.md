# coventry-chat-bot
This is a chat bot that will be made for computer science term one, 4006 CEM. 
In order to use the chatbot, a user must be created beforehand (This allows for security and in future, will allow preferences for users)
For demonstration purposes, please use the following details

Username: bob

Password: bob123

Note:
Currently, for the function " books " to work, the current search algorithm will accept words that are kangaroo words of the search terms, for example "Books" contains "Boo", and so the search algorithm will identify this as a valid response for books, however anything else will not be considered valid. This is due to the nature of searching for the word in a sentence so that the user may respond naturally.
Given time, this would be changed so that this no longer occurs.
